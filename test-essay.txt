My Worst Day Ever

Last week I had the worst day of my life. It started when I wake up late for school. I was so hurry that I forget to eat breakfast and I didn't brush my teeth neither. When I arrive at school I realize I left my homework at home. My teacher was very angry and she give me detention.

During lunch I was sitting with my friends and we was talking about the weekend. Suddenly I spill my milk all over my shirt. Everyone was laughing at me and I feel so embarrassed. I had to go to the nurse office to get a new shirt but they only had pink ones left. I hate pink color.

After school I was walking home when I see a dog running toward me. I was scared because I don't like dogs. The dog was barking loudly and I start to run away. I trip over a rock and fell down. My knee was bleeding and it hurt alot.

When I finally got home my mom was waiting for me. She ask me what happen and I told her everything. She said "don't worry tomorrow will be better day". I hope she is right because I don't want to have another day like this.

This experience taught me that sometimes bad things happen but we must stay positive. Even though it was terrible day I learned to be more careful and prepared for school. I also learned that pink shirts aren't so bad after all.

Now I always wake up early and I make sure to eat breakfast everyday. I also check my homework twice before leaving home. I think this experience made me a better student and person.
